#Basic algorithms



#Bubble sort is a well known algorithm for sorting a list.
#It works by looping over the list and comparing adjacent elements
#If two elements are out of order, it swaps them
#It keeps looping over the list, doing this until all of the elements are sorted

#Write a bubble sort function that sorts a list of number in increasing order.

def bubble_sort (unsorted):
    return None

#Bubble sort is famous for being really inefficient and slow.
#Can you think of another way of sorting a list of numbers that might be faster?

def my_sort (unsorted):
    return None

#A nested list is a list that contains lists.
#E.g the list [ [1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9] ] has 3 elements, each of which
#is also a list.
#lists can also be deeply nested - which means that lists can contain
#lists which can contain lists, and so on and so forth.

#Write a function that 'flattens' a list.
#That is, it takes a deeply nested list and returns a new list with all
#the non-list elements *in the correct order*.
#for example: [ [[1],2], [[3]], [4], 5] -> [1,2,3,4,5]

def flatten_list (deep_nested):
    return None
