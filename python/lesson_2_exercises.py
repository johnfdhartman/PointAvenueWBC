#Basic algorithms



#Bubble sort is a well known algorithm for sorting a list.
#It works by looping over the list and comparing adjacent elements
#If two elements are out of order, it swaps them
#It keeps looping over the list, doing this until all of the elements are sorted

#Write a bubble sort function that sorts a list of number in increasing order.

def bubble_sort (unsorted):
    return None

#Bubble sort is famous for being really inefficient and slow.
#Can you think of another way of sorting a list that might be faster?

def my_sort (unsorted):
    return None
