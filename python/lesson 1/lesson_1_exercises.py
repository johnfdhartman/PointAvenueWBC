# Hint: Use a for loop
def multiply_array (nums):

# Create a function that multiplies all the odd numbers in a list together, adds all the even numbers together, then returns those two numbers added together. Assume there are no negative elements
#  hint: use the modulus operator

# Create a function that returns the length of a string
# Do not use the in-built length() function for this

# Create a function that adds "ing" to the end of a string
# e.g 'abc' -> 'abcing'

# Create a function that takes a list of integers, and returns two new arrays: the first has all the even numbers, the second has all the odd numbers. the order of these lists is not changed.

#Create a function that multiplies each element of a list with the index of that element. e.g [2,2,2,2] -> [0, 2, 4, 6]

#Create a function that returns the nth fibonacci number. For example 6->8

#Create a function that takes a string of alternating 1-digit numbers and letters (for example '3a2b5q9z'), and then creates a new string which repeats each character by the preceding number of times.
#For example: '2a4q3n' -> 'aaqqqqnnn'
#Hint: You may find String.repeat(), String.split(), and Array.join() useful.

#write a function that returns the highest product of *consecutive* numbers in a list of at least 2 elements
#For example, [5,2,10,9,11,3] -> 99, because 9*11 is the highest product of consecutive numbers. Some numbers might be negative!

def highest_pair (nums):
    return None

#A sub-list is a part of a list that can be made without any gaps. For example [7,2,3] is a sub-list of [4,7,2,3,1]. But [7,3] is not a sub-list because it skips 2. And [3,2,1] is not a sub-list because it is in the incorrect order. A sub-list can have one element.

#Write a function that takes a list of numbers (positive, negative, and zero) and returns the highest *sum* that can be made from a sub-list.

#This is a tricky one! Make sure you think of *all* the different kinds of input your function could get.
